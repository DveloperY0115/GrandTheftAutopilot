    extent of the lane (going from the result shown in raw-lines-example.mp4
    to that shown in P1_example.mp4).

    Think about things like separating line segments by their
    slope ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)) to decide which segments are part of the left
    line vs. the right line.  Then, you can average the position of each of
    the lines and extrapolate to the top and bottom of the lane.

    This function draws `lines` with `color` and `thickness`.
    Lines are drawn on the image inplace (mutates the image).
    If you want to make the lines semi-transparent, think about combining
    this function with the add_images() function below
